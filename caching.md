- Look up data in database can be slow.
- Looking same data over and over again can really slow application
- In-memory cache helps on this

### ElastiCache:
- ElastiCache **helps to manage and deploy** two most common types of in-memory cache: Mimcached and Redis
- Redis is the popular
- You can deploy Mimcache or Redis yourself but Amazon has services to manage it
